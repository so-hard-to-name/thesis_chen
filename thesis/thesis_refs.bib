              Even though disease severity scores are not the key elements of
              treatment, they are however, an essential part of improvement in
              clinical decisions and in identifying patients with unexpected

              application of these models helps in decision making at the right
              time and in decreasing hospital cost. In fact, they have become a
              necessary tool to describe ICU populations and to explain
              differences in mortality. However, it is also important to note
              that the choice of the severity score scale, index, or model
              should accurately match the event, setting or application; as
              mis-application, of such systems can lead to wastage of time,

The appropriate application of ML to these data promises to transform patient risk stratification broadly in the field of medicine and especially in infectious diseases. This, in turn, could lead to targeted interventions that reduce the spread of healthcare-associated pathogens. In this review, we begin with an introduction to the basics of ML. We then move on to discuss how ML can transform healthcare epidemiology, providing examples of successful applications.

              morbidity and mortality, increasing prevalence and escalating

              based on patient-specific characteristics from Electronic Health
              Records (EHRs), we can identify high-risk patients and apply
              individualized treatment and healthy living choices to
              potentially reduce their mortality risk. The Seattle Heart
              Failure Model (SHFM) is one of the most popular models to
              calculate HF survival risk that uses multiple clinical variables
              to predict HF prognosis and also incorporates impact of HF
              therapy on patient outcomes. Although the SHFM has been validated
              across multiple cohorts [1-5], these studies were primarily done
              using clinical trials databases that do not reflect routine
              clinical care in the community. Further, the impact of
              contemporary therapeutic interventions, such as beta-blockers or
              defibrillators, was incorporated in SHFM by extrapolation from
              external trials. In this study, we assess the performance of SHFM
              using EHRs at Mayo Clinic, and sought to develop a risk
              prediction model using machine learning techiniques that applies
              routine clinical care data. Our results shows the models which
              were built using EHR data are more accurate (11\% improvement in
              AUC) with the convenience of being more readily applicable in
              routine clinical care. Furthermore, we demonstrate that new
              predictive markers (such as co-morbidities) when incorporated
              into our models improve prognostic performance significantly (8\%
              improvement in AUC).",

  abstract = "Purpose of review The review considers problems in critical
              illness and critical care in the context of complex systems
              science. Normal physiology is characterized by nonlinear
              dynamics, and it appears that the pathophysiology of critical
              illness alters those dynamics. Recent findings Recent evidence
              confirms and extends the observation that the rich variability
              that characterizes normal physiology ``decomplexifies'' with
              critical illness. Experimental data in animals and now in humans
              suggests that physiologic support that mimics normal variability
              may reduce the severity and/or duration of the illness. Summary
              Physiologic dynamics in health and in critical illness appear to
              reflect complex, interconnected systems biology. Alterations in
              illness and during recovery may provide important clues to the
              underlying structure of the system. With knowledge of the
              structure, therapy could be better focused toward supporting both
              function and dynamics, offering hope for improved outcomes.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine which of the
               most commonly used scoring systems for evaluation of critically
               ill patients in the ICU is the best and simplest to use in our
               hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included
               60 critically ill patients. After admittance to the ICU, APACHE
               II, SAPS II, and MPM II0 were calculated. During further
               treatment in the ICU, SOFA and MPM II were calculated at 24 h,
               48 h, and 72 h and 7 days after admittance using laboratory and
               radiological measures. RESULTS: In comparison with survivors,
               non-survivors were older (p<0.01) and spent significantly more
               days on mechanical ventilation (p<0.01). ARDS was significantly
               more common in patients who survived compared to those who did
               not (chi-square=7.02, p<0.01), which is not the case with sepsis
               (chi-square=0.388, p=0.53). AUROC SAPS II was 0.690, and is only
               slightly higher than the other 2 AUROC incipient scoring
               systems, MPM II and APACHE II (0.654 and 0.623). The APACHE II
               has the highest specificity (81.8\%) and MPM II the highest
               sensitivity (85.2\%). MPM II(7day) AUROC (1.0) shows the best
               discrimination between patients who survived and those who did
               not. MPM II(48) (0.836), SOFA(72) (0.821) and MPM II(72) (0.817)
               also had good discrimination scores. CONCLUSIONS: APACHE II and
               SAPS II measured on admission to the ICU were significant
               predictors of complications. MPM II(7day) has the best
               discriminatory power, followed by SOFA(7day) and MPM II(48). MPM
               II(7day) has the best calibration followed by SOFA(7day) and

    abstract = {Background and objective
    Sepsis occurs in response to an infection in the body and can progress to a fatal stage. Detection and monitoring of sepsis require multi-step analysis, which is time-consuming, costly and requires medically trained personnel. A metric called Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is used to determine the severity of sepsis. This score depends heavily on laboratory measurements. In this study, we offer a computational solution for quantitatively monitoring sepsis symptoms and organ systems state without laboratory test. To this end, we propose to employ a regression-based analysis by using only seven vital signs that can be acquired from bedside in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to predict the exact value of SOFA score of patients before sepsis occurrence.
    Methods
    A model called Deep SOFA-Sepsis Prediction Algorithm (DSPA) is introduced. In this model, we combined Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) features with Random Forest (RF) algorithm to predict SOFA scores of sepsis patients. A subset of Medical Information Mart in Intensive Care (MIMIC) III dataset is used in experiments. 5154 samples are extracted as input. Ten-fold cross validation test are carried out for experiments.
    Results
    We demonstrated that our model has achieved a Correlation Coefficient (CC) of 0.863, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.659, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.23 for predictions at sepsis onset. The accuracies of SOFA score predictions for 6 hours before sepsis onset were 0.842, 0.697, and 1.308, in terms of CC, MAE and RMSE, respectively. Our model outperformed traditional machine learning and deep learning models in regression analysis. We also evaluated our model's prediction performance for identifying sepsis patients in a binary classification setup. Our model achieved up to 0.982 AUC (Area Under Curve) for sepsis onset and 0.972 AUC for 6 hours before sepsis, which are higher than those reported by previous studies.
    Conclusions
    By utilizing SOFA scores, our framework facilitates the prognose of sepsis and infected organ systems state. While previous studies focused only on predicting presence of sepsis, our model aims at providing a prognosis solution for sepsis. SOFA score estimation process in ICU depends on laboratory environment. This dependence causes delays in treating patients, which in turn may increase the risk of complications. By using easily accessible non-invasive vital signs that are routinely collected in ICU, our framework can eliminate this delay. We believe that the estimation of the SOFA score will also help health professionals to monitor organ states.}

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Severity of illness scores have gained considerable
               interest for their use in predicting outcomes such as mortality
               and length of stay. The most sophisticated scoring systems
               require the collection of numerous physiologic measurements,
               making their use in real-time difficult. A severity of illness
               score based on a few parameters that can be captured
               electronically would be of great benefit. Using a
               machine-learning technique known as particle swarm optimization,
               we attempted to reduce the number of physiologic parameters
               collected in the Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health
               Evaluation IV system without losing predictive accuracy. DESIGN:
               Retrospective cohort study of ICU admissions from 2007 to 2011.
               SETTING: Eighty-six ICUs at 49 U.S. hospitals where an Acute
               Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation IV system had
               been installed. PATIENTS: 81,087 admissions, of which 72,474 did
               not have any missing values. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS
               AND MAIN RESULTS: Machine-learning algorithms were used to come
               up with the minimal set of variables that were capable of
               yielding an accurate severity of illness score: the Oxford Acute
               Severity of Illness Score. Predictive models of ICU mortality
               using Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score were developed on
               admissions during 2007-2009 and validated on admissions during
               2010-2011. The most parsimonious Oxford Acute Severity of
               Illness Score consisted of seven physiologic measurements,
               elective surgery, age, and prior length of stay. Predictive
               models of ICU mortality using Oxford Acute Severity of Illness
               Score achieved an area under the receiver operating
               characteristic curve of 0.88 and calibrated well. CONCLUSIONS: A
               reduced severity of illness score had discrimination and
               calibration equivalent to more complex existing models. This was
               accomplished in large part using machine-learning algorithms,

More than half of the patients with cancer receive ionizing radiation (radiotherapy) as part of their treatment, and it is the main treatment modality at advanced stages of local disease. Radiotherapy involves a large set of processes that not only span the period from consultation to treatment but also extend beyond that to ensure that the patients have received the prescribed radiation dose and are responding well. The degrees of the complexity of these processes can vary and may involve several stages of sophisticated human-machine interactions and decision making, which would naturally invite the use of machine learning algorithms into optimizing and automating these processes including but not limited to radiation physics quality assurance, contouring and treatment planning, image-guided radiotherapy, respiratory motion management, treatment response modeling, and outcomes prediction. The ability of machine learning algorithms to learn from current context and generalize into unseen tasks would allow improvements in both the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy practice leading to better outcomes.",
